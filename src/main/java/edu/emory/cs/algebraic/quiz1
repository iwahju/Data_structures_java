1. What is the advantage of using Generics?
It is type safety, there is no need to write code to test for the
correct data type because it is enforced at compile time.
We also can write less code and it also have better performance.

2.How do you make the class you define comparable?
To be able to make an object comparable, the class must implement
the comparable interface.

3.What is the advantage of overriding member methods in the Object class?
The advantage of method overriding is that the class can have its own implementation to a
inherited methods without modifying the parent class code.
Which means a subclass can implement a parent class method.

4.What kind of methods should be defined as static?
When you need a method, which you want to call directly by class name, we should make that method static.
